        I am a software developer in the making and always eager to acquire new
        skills. I am self-taught and have a strong drive to succeed in this
        field. As a team player, I value collaboration and constructive
        feedback. I am always up for new challenges and committed to pursuing a
        career in software development. I have completed several projects,
        through each I gained hands-on experience and knowledge about the
        software technologies used, including their functionalities, strengths,
        and weaknesses. I was able to identify the problems they can solve and
        how they can be used to develop robust and scalable applications.
